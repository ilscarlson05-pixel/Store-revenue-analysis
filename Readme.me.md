# Store Revenue Analysis (2023)

## Project Description
This project calculates and visualizes the total revenue generated by stores of different sizes in each country for the year 2023.  
It helps understand how small, medium, and large stores contribute to revenue across countries.

## Data
- `data/sample_sales_data.csv` : sample sales data (dummy data)  
- `sql/revenue_by_store.sql` : SQL query calculating revenue by store size  
- `visuals/revenue_by_country.png` : optional chart showing revenue distribution

## Method
1. Joined the `sales` table with the `store` table on `storekey`.  
2. Used `SUM` with `CASE WHEN` to calculate revenue for different store sizes:  
   - Small: `<1000 sqm`  
   - Medium: `1000â€“2000 sqm`  
   - Large: `>2000 sqm`  
3. Excluded "Online" stores from analysis.  
4. Grouped results by `countryname` and ordered alphabetically.  

## Insights (from sample data)
- Small stores contribute mostly in countries with smaller average store sizes.  
- Large stores generate higher revenue in countries with bigger stores.  
- Online stores are excluded from this analysis.

## How to Use
1. Open `sql/revenue_by_store.sql` in your SQL environment.  
2. Run the query on `sample_sales_data.csv` (or your own data).  
3. Optional: Use the results to create visualizations, such as bar charts.
